## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before tasks-to-issues conversion)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_taskstoissues` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, do NOT silently skip hook checking: stop and tell the user `.specify/extensions.yml` failed to parse, since a mandatory hook may be defined in it that would otherwise go unenforced, and ask them to confirm proceeding without hook checking before continuing
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing slash commands from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`): Follow `.specify/memory/hook-trust-policy.md` (trust gate, then invocation rules) before emitting or running this. Emit:
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
1. **IF EXISTS**: Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for project principles and governance constraints.
1. The script's JSON output does not include a `TASKS` field. Derive it yourself as `TASKS="$FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md"` and confirm the file exists (`--require-tasks` already causes the script to fail if it does not, but verify again here defensively) before reading it.
1. Get the Git remote by running:

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

Normalize this URL (HTTPS form `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git` or SSH form
`git@github.com:OWNER/REPO.git`) into the exact `OWNER/REPO` pair. Use that derived pair as the
explicit repository target for every GitHub MCP `list_issues` and `create_issue` call in this
skill; do not rely on the MCP tool's ambient/default repository context. If the pair cannot be
derived, abort before any GitHub operation.

> [!CAUTION]
> ONLY PROCEED TO NEXT STEPS IF THE REMOTE IS A GITHUB URL

1. **Fetch existing issues for deduplication**: Before creating anything, build the set of task IDs you are about to process from `tasks.md`, considering only unchecked tasks (`- [ ]`) by default and excluding completed tasks (`- [X]` / `- [x]`) from both deduplication and issue creation; only include completed tasks if the user explicitly asks for issues covering completed work. Each task ID is a `T` followed by one or more digits, e.g. `T001` or `T1000`. Then use the GitHub MCP server's `list_issues` tool to look for issues that already cover those IDs. Do not pass a `state` value, since omitting it makes the tool return both open and closed issues. Request `perPage: 100` to keep the number of calls down, and since the tool uses cursor-based pagination, request pages with the `after` parameter (using the `endCursor` from the previous response). For each issue title, match it against the task ID pattern `\bT\d+\b` (word boundaries so tokens like `ST001` are not matched by mistake, while `T001`, `T1000`, and similar longer IDs are; this also recognises titles written as `T001 ...`, `T001: ...` or `[T001] ...`) and, when it matches one of your task IDs, mark that ID as already having an issue. Stop paginating as soon as every task ID has been matched, or when there are no more pages, so you do not keep fetching the whole repository's issue history once all task IDs are accounted for. This bounds the number of calls on repos with large issue histories and still prevents duplicates when the command is re-run after `tasks.md` is regenerated or the skill is re-invoked.
1. **Preview before creating anything**: Compute the final list of tasks that will get a new issue (those without an existing match from the previous step) and show the user, before any `create_issue` call: the target repository (`OWNER/REPO`), the total count of issues about to be created, and each issue's exact title. Explicitly ask the user to approve this batch. Do not proceed to the next step until the user approves; if the user rejects or asks for changes, stop and do not create any issues.
1. For each approved task in the list, use the GitHub MCP server to create a new issue in the repository that is representative of the Git remote. Task lines in `tasks.md` start with a markdown checkbox, so first strip the leading `- [ ]` (and any `[P]` / `[US#]` markers) to recover the task ID and its description. Create the issue with a single canonical title of the form `T001: <description>`, with the ID written once followed by the task description (for example, the line `- [ ] T001 Create project structure` becomes the title `T001: Create project structure`).
   - **Skip** any task whose ID is already present in the set of existing issues from the previous step, and report it (for example, `T001 already has an issue, skipping`).
   - Only create issues for tasks that do not yet have a matching issue.

> [!CAUTION]
> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVER CREATE ISSUES IN REPOSITORIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THE REMOTE URL

## Post-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (after tasks-to-issues conversion)**:
Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_taskstoissues` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, do NOT silently skip hook checking: stop and tell the user `.specify/extensions.yml` failed to parse, since a mandatory hook may be defined in it that would otherwise go unenforced, and ask them to confirm proceeding without hook checking before continuing
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing slash commands from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`): Follow `.specify/memory/hook-trust-policy.md` (trust gate, then invocation rules) before emitting or running this. Emit:
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently
